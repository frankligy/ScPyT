# ScPyT
Scientific Computing in Python, a practical and ultimate tutorials

# What is this repository? :

Scientific Computing scans a wide spectrum including basic numeric programming, linear algebra, all kinds of distributions, and realizing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling. This tutorial aims to help you to master the basic skills to implement relevant algorithms in python.
