## ODE

To reproduce the figures in [Tyson et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955067403000176), it is the homework for University of Cincinnati, Computation System Biology class in 2021 Spring semester. 

It also includes a few more example for the final exam, which is to reproduce figures from [Zhang et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cc.6.1.3705).

## Layout

1. the final submission can be found in submission folder (include link to code snippets)
2. the code can be found in script folder
3. the reproduced figures can be found in figures folder
4. the final exam codes and submission can be found in final folder (how to use solve_ivp from scipy when having multiple dependent variable?)
